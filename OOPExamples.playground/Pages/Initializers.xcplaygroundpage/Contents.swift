 # Initializers
 
 We learnt from the previous page that initializers are special functions that allow us to set an initial state for a class
 
 There are different types of initializers we can define in a class.
 
 There are *default*, *required*, *convenience* and *failable* initializers

/*:
 ## Default/Designated Initializers
 
 >>>
 Designated initializers are the primary initializers for a class. A designated initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the superclass chain. - Apple
