 # Object Oriented Programming
 
 ## Modeling Data with Classes
 
 Using classes, we can model data.
 
 ***Initiallizers*** allow us to set the initial state of a class
 
 Variables and Constants that live in the *scope* of the class are referred to as ***instance variables***
 
 The ***self*** keyword used in class is used to refer to the current instance.

 ## Creating an Instance
  Creating an Animal is called creating and ***instance*** of the class Animal

/*:
 ## Scope
 
 Classes encapsulate variables and functions.
 i.e they can have variables and functions.
 
 Variables that live at the *top* level of the class are global to the class. That means they can be access by functions in the class.

 ## Class functions vs Static functions

 Functions in classes can have some modifiers attached to them.
 
 *Regular functions in classes*
 They can be regular functions, that is, we need an instance of the class to call those methods.
 
 *Class functions in classes*
 They are functions in classes that belong to the class itself, you do not need an instance to access the method. Subclasses can *override* them.
 eg. Calculator.off()
 
 *Static functions in classes*
 They work similarly to *classes* except they cannot be overriden by subclasses
 */

//    override static func on() {
//    }
    
}

Calculator.off()
Calculator.on()

/*:
 ## Static Variables
 
 Variables in classes can have the static keyword attached to them.
 A static variable belongs to the class. ie. You do not need an instance of the class to access it
 
 */

class Phone {

Phone.size

/*:
 ## Access Modifiers
 
Variables and functions in classes can be **private, or public**
 
 Variables and functions are public by default
 
 */

class Todo {

    public let completed: Bool = false
}

// Cannot access content because its private
// todo1.content

// Can access public variables
todo1.completed


/*:
 ## Final Classes
 
 Classes can be marked with the final keyword,
 meaning it cannot be subclassed.
 
 You cannot subclass the class below
 */

    }

/*:
class BlueTable: Table {
}
 We get the error if we try to subclass Table:
 
 *Error* inheritance from a final class 'Table'

/*:
 ## Class Extenstions
 
 We can extend a class to provide extra functionality
 
 */

    let item: String
    
    init(item: String) {

 ## Initializers and Deinitializers
 **Initializers** are special functions that allow us to setup initial state of a class.
 
 **Deinitializers** are special functions that are called when a class is destroyed/removed/deallocated from memory
